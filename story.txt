One day a man named Mark Octavion was eating his eight morning bowls of cereal when he had a great idea. Between every bowl of cereal Mark would have to go get a new spoon as to not contaminate a fresh bowl of cereal with an old utensile. This became tedious as he had eight spoons in the dishwasher every night. Mark's new idea was going to change all of that...

After two days, he came up with many ideas. And, he tried each idea on everyday. Finally, he found that the idea that works is an idea that he invent a new spoon. This spoon called e-spoon. This spoon can be washed by itself using only three minutes to wash. E-spoon not only help him to solve th problemm, but it also helps the world to save water. He invents the spoons for himself and also sold to the public. Finally, he became billionaires because of his e-spoon

No one knows better about spoons than I do, this became Mark's catch phrase after his great success. However it turned out someone did, not very long after the patent of e-spoon expired, hundreds of thousands of knonoffs that were way cheaper and better functioning sprout across the globe. While his career in great crisis, Mark recalled back to the life-changing day that he no longer wanted to wash his eight spoons and decided that we would make his e-spoon great again.
